If we do not import the dependencies.jar file then the code will throw 
ClassNotFoundException while runtime. 

Because when we de-serialize any object there must be class present by which the object
is created. 

Then we can create the jar file from day17_ser package and import here using 
Build Path option in right click menu.

We can create jar using export present into right click menu where we select the 
Java and then jar file for creating the jar file on specified path in system.
